# Algorithms: Ruby [![Algorithms](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mtuopensource/Algorithms.svg)](https://github.com/mtuopensource/Algorithms)

Collection of algorithms implemented in Ruby. 

## Installation

### Requirements
* Windows, Linux, or macOS
* Ruby 2.5 and up

## Getting Started
Make sure you run a bundle install to download rspec onto your machine

If you do not have the bundler gem run
     
     gem install bundler
     
Once you have the bundler move into the ruby directory of this repository and run

    sudo bundle install

**Great!** Now you should have rspec installed on your machine

Now let's run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly

Running the rspec unit tests is simple. While in the ruby directory, run

    rspec --format doc
    
You should then see all of the test ran by rspec. Make sure their arn't any errors
